% Description mathématique (1ère page)
\Setup{math description={
        This project involves an optimization problems with constraints with some knowledges
        (predictive data).
        \begin{bullets}
        \item Minimize a cost function to fit the eroadmap in function of real energy production.
        \item Introduce constraints in the problem (Battery types, household production law imposed by governments).
        \item Add predictive data (weather prediction, house energy knowledges,\ldots) in the model to handle free schedule.
        \end{bullets}
}}

% Description du problème et du contexte
\Setup{problem description={
        With the multiplications of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and the
        possibility to own its energy production, new problems emerged:
        (i) Massive energy rejection causes electrical network disturbances.
        (ii) Energy distributors imposed regulates household consumption in function of stock exchange prices. 
        (iii) Energy waste due to non-consumed or non-selled energy during free schedule.
    }}

% But de la collaboration
\Setup{goal={
        The goal is first to control the energy
        storage via energy buffers (batteries) and the rejection in the
        electrical network with respect to distributors consigns (eroadmap).
        Minimizing energy costs, maximizing energy resale during free schedule.
    }}

% Résultat (2ème page)
\Setup{results={
A prototype of working algorithm has been establish during a 
6 month works financed by AMIES PEPS contracts and master internship. The solution
proposed is a strategy to fit the eroadmap taking into account predictive data.
This works solved a blocking problem for the company which patented the algorithm
and implemented it in the EMG controller for production.
