%%% SUCCESS STORIES
%%%
%%% AMIES and FMSP, based on the Eu-Maths-In initiative
%%%
%%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% TEMPLATE EXAMPLE
%%%
%%% The class file success stories as well as the proper fonts shall be installed in the appropriate directories.
%%%
%%% ILLUSTRATIONS
%%%	Each sheet is illustrated with
%%%	- one picture in the front page
%%%     - one academic logo (multiple logos must be merged into a single file)
%%%     - one industriel logo (multiple logos must be merged into a single file)
%%%	Various formats can be used for the pictures: .pdf, .png, .jpg.
%%%	Please avoid heavy (≥ 1Mb) images.
%%%
%%% Logo positionning may be tricky as there are various size. It will be fine-tuned during the production phase
%%%
%%% IDENTIFIER
%%%	Each sheet is identified through a single identifier, for example the compact name of the project.
%%%	The file is named after this identifier. It is given in the MetaData section.
%%%
%%% LATEX
%%%	The content should be typesetted using minimal LaTex features (only \emph{}, \textbf{}, \textit{}).
%%%	Use the `bullet` environment of lists.

    \textbf{Math description}
      ExactCure leverages a proprietary Artificial Intelligence to create personalized biomodels of drugs by adjusting an ideal posology and tightly monitoring the therapy.

      Pharmacokinetic models reflect the fate of a drug in an organism, from
absorption to distribution, metabolism and elimination. They are systems of
Ordinary Differential Equations. Their dynamics is calibrated on populations of
patients thanks to clinical trials. Their parameters are random variables that
integrate the inter-patient variability. They are Non Linear Mixed Effect
Models.  Our ExactCure/Inria collaboration leverages skills in dynamical
systems and control theory in the context of pharmacokinetics modelling.

% Problem and context description (front page)
\Setup{
    problem description={
Inappropriate medications kill more people than car accidents do! 3 times more,
costing France 10 billion euros of health insurance per year.
Why is it so complex? We are all different, we differently respond to drugs.

% Goal of the collaboration (front page)
\Setup{goal={
	\begin{bullets}
	\item Analysis of the dynamic properties of pharmacokinetic structures
	\item Integration of lacunar patient data
	\item Mapping of population models to individual characteristics

% Results (back page)
  \Setup{
      results={
In pharmacokinetics modelling, personalization means to estime/adjust kinetic parameters from personnalized data.
We have developed cutting-edge technologies for rigorous and smart integration of such personalized data in our proprietary calibration pipeline. The underlying mathematical techniques form the cornerstone of very challenging collaborations between ExactCure and Inria.
